PHISHING EMAIL ANALYSIS REPORT – TASK 2

1. Overview
This report analyzes a sample phishing email to identify red flags, malicious indicators, and social engineering techniques used by attackers. The objective is to understand how phishing attempts compromise user trust and how to detect them using structural analysis, header inspection, and link verification.

2. Email Sample Analyzed
Subject: Your Account Will Be Locked – Immediate Action Required!
Sender Display Name: Microsoft Support
Actual Sender Email: support-secure@micros0ft-services.com
Message: “Your account is scheduled for suspension. Verify immediately.”
Button/Link: “Verify Your Account”
Actual URL: http://secure-verification-login.microsoft-check-auth.io/login
Attachment: Account_Update_Form.zip

3. Phishing Indicators Identified

A. Sender Address Abuse / Email Spoofing
- Display name is “Microsoft Support,” but domain is micros0ft-services.com.
- The “0” instead of “o” is a classic typosquatting technique.
- Domain is not owned by Microsoft.

B. Suspicious & Mismatched Links
Displayed link: https://microsoft.com/security
Actual redirect: http://secure-verification-login.microsoft-check-auth.io/login
This uses multi-subdomain obfuscation to appear legitimate.

C. Urgency / Fear-Based Language
Examples:
- “Your account will be locked!”
- “Immediate action required”
- “Verify now to avoid suspension”
Attackers try to trigger panic and quick action.

D. Unusual Attachment (ZIP File)
Attachment: Account_Update_Form.zip
ZIP files often contain:
- Keyloggers
- Remote access trojans
- Credential stealers
Legitimate companies never send verification forms inside ZIP files.

E. Spelling & Grammar Errors
Examples found:
- “Your account will be suspend.”
- “Please update immediatly.”
These are common in phishing emails.

F. Header Analysis (Using MXToolbox / Google Header Analyzer)
- SPF: FAIL (Sender not authorized for domain)
- DKIM: Invalid signature
- DMARC: No policy alignment
- “Received” path shows routing through unknown overseas servers
Indicates sender identity is spoofed.

4. Social Engineering Techniques Used

1. Authority Abuse  
   Pretends to be Microsoft technical support.

2. Fear & Urgency  
   “Your account will be locked” forces fast action.

3. Link Masking  
   Text shows a trusted URL but redirects elsewhere.

4. Brand Imitation  
   Uses Microsoft colors, style, branding.

5. Attachment Bait  
   ZIP file disguised as a verification form.

5. Threat Summary
If the user opened the link or the ZIP file, possible risks include:
- Credential theft
- Malware installation
- Keylogging
- Account compromise
- Identity theft
- Internal network infiltration

6. Conclusion
The analyzed email is a high-risk phishing attempt. It uses spoofed domains, suspicious attachments, fear-based language, mismatched URLs, and authentication header failures. All signs indicate it is malicious and should be immediately reported and blocked.

7. Recommended Countermeasures
- Do NOT click any links or open the attachment.
- Report the email to the organization’s security team.
